<h1>Personal Interview conducted with SSG Truffa on the use of Leaderzone</h1>
<h3>SSG Christopher Truffa is the station commander of the Erie Recruiting Center in Erie, PA.
</h3>

<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold">What are some of the major features of leaderzone and what do they do?</span><br />
SSG Truffa: Leaderzone allows station commanders to track recruiting from the lowest level to the highest level.  I have access to individual records, recruiter remarks, historical data, mission breakdowns, production efficiency, and planned guidance. 
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold">What is the most important feature of leaderzone</span><br />
SSG Truffa: For me the most important feature of Leaderzone is prospecting analysis.
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold">Briefly describe the most important feature</span><br />
SSG Truffa: Prospecting analysis allows me to see how many attempts it takes to make an appointment, conduct an appointment, test and qualify, and actually contract that individual.  This ability gives me a chance to then goal each recruiter for a certain number of attempts to then be successful as a station.  Without this tool I would have no collective data from the group and wouldn’t be able to adjust work that we do day to day.
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold">What do you use leaderzone for on a daily basis</span><br />
SSG Truffa: Daily I use it to check records, review who we have contracting in the next 2 - 4 weeks, ensure we haven’t forgotten to conduct follow ups, track individuals who require waivers and medical reviews, and approve daily work plans. 
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight:bold">In your experience what does senior leadership (ie. company, battalion, brigade) use leader zone for?</span><br />
For leaders at every level this system allows us to check the level above and below us. I am able to check to make sure my station is being the most productive it can be.  The company and battalion level is able to do that as well for themselves and for me.  If there is a point of emphasis that needs addressing it is usually noticed in Leaderzone and then materialized into training to correct said deficiency.  Because our organization is so geographically dispersed it gives a way for every level to be involved to produce the most efficient recruiting station.
